# Generative stuff

This repository contains results of my experiments with generative art, procedural generation, l-systems etc.

Examples:

### Random walk

This is an example of a random walk. The plot starts with a point and walks the plane in an iterative manner. On each step the program decides where to go. This creates a path that appears almost like an organic structure. To me it resembles models of chemical compounds, especially proteins, which have complex spatial structures.

### Distorted mesh

This is a simple but fun example of a random noise added to a regular grid.

### Moire pattern

The example below shows a Moire pattern generated by rotating a copy of scatter plot over the original one. This was inspired by a video from the Numberphile channel [Freaky Dot Patterns - Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAja2jp1VjE)
